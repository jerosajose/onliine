        <h1>Directed by</h1>
        <p>JerosGamer89 (me)</p>

        <p>My free time</p>

        <h1>Jokes aside</h1>
        <p>
            This website has been created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript
            and jQuery, with the help of:
            
            <h3>wii.js.org by @andrewplus</h3>
            <p>
                The main inspiration and motivation to build this site. Even though they
                look very similar, this has been made from scrath, using all the UI assets
                at his project with some tweaks, mainly to have an easy start with the site.
                <br><br>
                Now it's sort of abandoned, but it still runs great, check him out on GitHub.
            </p>

            <h3>The Spriters Resource &ndash; spriters-resource.com/wii</h3>
            <p>
                It's an amazing site with a really enthusiastic community. Pretty much all the
                images left to complete the site, that weren't on andrew's site, have been taken
                from there. All the content that peopled uploaded there plus some CSS animations
                made possible the main menu channel arts.
            </p>

            <h3>Dolphin Emulator & YouTube tour videos</h3>
            <p>
                Another great source of inspiration to know how is exactly everything is styled.
                System audio effects have also been obtained through YouTube and SoundCloud.
            </p>

            <h3>EZGIF &ndash; ezgif.com</h3>
            <p>
                Really, really handy website for whatever thing you wanna do with GIFs.
                It's been mainly used with video conversion and some trickery for channel
                banners videos.
            </p>

            <h3>Fontworks &ndash; lets.fontworks.co.jp</h3>
            <p>
                The original authors of the famous Rodin font used on both Wii and Wii U.
            </p>

            <h3>Other tools used</h3>
            <p>
                Gyazo (for video (banner) capture), Nintendo's web (Mii Studio), GIMP (image editing),
                Inkscape (logo design)
            </p>

            <h1>Not affiliated</h1>
            <p>
                Of course, I am not affiliated with Nintendo, and Wii, the Wii logo and many
                other things in the website (not to say almost everything) is copyrighted
